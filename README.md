# File Manager

### overview
This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) file manager that allows users to perform various file operations through text commands. Users can navigate through directories, move files or directories, copy files or directories, and delete files or directories. The purpose of this project was to enhance my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), including class management and the use of lambda functions.
***This project is not yet final; I plan to add additional features in the future.***
